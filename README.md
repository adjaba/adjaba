Thanks for visiting my Github page! Check out some of my repos:
- [**GistHub**](https://gisthub-rho.vercel.app/) <br> 
GistHub is a platform for developers to share code and text snippets to whomever they want. This project addresses a design concern with Github secret gists - anyone with the URL can [view these gists](https://gist.github.com/zmwangx/bc79e7d95d82c2f5e0976975b6e1c6d6), which makes it hard for developers to control access to their gists. I worked with two others to build Gisthub in 24 hours during HackMIT 2021. Gisthub supports the creation of public and <i>private</i> code and text snippets and serves as a tool for developers to create gists and view gists shared with them. [Check it out!](https://gisthub-rho.vercel.app/)
- [**Video Annotation Tool**](https://www.github.com/adjaba/video-annotation-tool) <br> 
A website I built with React, Node.js and SQL during my internship at NCSOFT that allows users to upload videos, annotate it for scene recognition, and output a JSON. The tool is primarily built for baseball videos to be annotated frame-by-frame with appropriate "events", "scenes", and "actions" for game highlights. More details and documentation on features can be found [here](https://www.github.com/adjaba/video-annotation-tool/README.md).
- [**Icon Style Transfer**](https://www.github.com/adjaba/icon-ui) <br> 
A website I built with React and Flask that allows users to upload pictures, and returns from 5 to 25 image samples with the selected styles (ex: wood, paper, metal, stone) up to 25 samples for each of 40 alpha parameter values. This tool interacts with a TensorFlow serving model to get the images, and sends a request for every image. Users can view images that use different alpha parameters in real time by adjusting the alpha slider and select the images they want to download at a side panel.
